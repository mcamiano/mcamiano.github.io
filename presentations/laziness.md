# Lazy is not Crazy
## But it might be stupid

--

### Making decisions early inhibits decisions made later, obviating one class of risk by blocking unknown future opportunities.

- Static vs Dynamic Language
- Compiled Binary vs Script
- Jeckle vs Wordpress CMS
- Eager vs Lazy Account Registration

--

### Lazy evaluation and late binding are ways to defer decisions; but it is a trade-off between opportunity and risk.

- Buy now or Borrow?
  - Owned vs Mortgaged House
  - Leased vs Purchased Equipment
- Promises Pattern
- OO: properties and operators are methods, methods are messages
