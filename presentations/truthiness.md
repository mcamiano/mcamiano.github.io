# On the Nature of Truth
## Truth is a verb, not a noun.

--

## Definition: Truth: 

> That which is in accordance with fact or reality

--

## Nothing is timeless, not excepting time itself.

* time is relative to a reference frame and is subject to distortion
* ...which we can only observe by the changes in fact and reality
* ...everything is subject to a constant dynamic of change, including you
* ...and the brain you use to observe changes, that is, to infer truth.

--

## Definition: Verb: 

> Describing an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of a predicate

--

## Truth is understood by continuous observation. What does that mean physically? 

* Truth is the main part of a predicate, that being our own dialog about any subject at all.
* Truth is an action upon, state of, or occurrence of a change in, mental processes.

## There is more of verbishness to truth than nounishness

* **We** and our observations are actions, states, and occurrences.
* The only observable truth we know is that which we communicate among ourselves.
* All truth as we know it must therefore be comprised of words that describe us and our observations.
* Ergo, truth is more verb than noun.
